Jamestown Plus Review

-- show montage of bullet dodging--

Well here we are. After five long years, Jamestown Plus finally makes its way
to PC.  Let's see how this version of the game holds up after nearly a decade
since the original Steam release.

For those of you that are unfamiliar with Bullet Hell shooters, here's a small
collection of gameplay to get you brought up to speed.  --Play DoDonpachi,
Deathsmiles, Mushishihimesama, Blue Revolver--

While individual mechanics and aesthetics greatly differ in these titles,
all good shooters abide by two essential rules.

1). Visual Clarity. 

Can the player track what's happening onscreen at any given moment? 
Can they distinguish what lies in the foreground versus the background? Is it
easy to tell what is and is not an enemy?  Are projectiles distinct
from all other objects, so that they don't blend into their surroundings?

No matter how many bullets are flying across the screen, a well-designed shmup
should always be visually readable by the player. 


2). Precise Player Movement

Given that shooters often require pixel perfect timing to avoid attacks,
accurate player movement is necessary. In general, you should always be able to
predict where your ship will go at any given moment. So systems like
acceleration or ending inertia directly work against this principle.

Although I've noticed some issues with visual clarity, Jamestown otherwise
meets these criteria, while adding in some of its own interesting mechanics.

Let me briefly talk about the basics. (gush about vaunting)

Where Jamestown sets itself apart from other shooters is in the insane amount
of ship variety. You can choose between 12 vehicles, 3 of which have
customizable specials and firing patterns. While some of the choices are a bit
redundant, I appreciate the amount of strategic options given to the player.  

There are some oversights with their mechanical designs. First, ships with
controllable projectiles are far more reliable than ones without them. Most
notably, the Gunner pilot, which has 360 degree bullet firing, is the most
useful on a regular basis. That's not to say that the other ships are bad, but
I find the improved positioning offer by Gunner to be far more useful than the
extra damage potential from ships with static firing patterns like Bomber. That
said, I don't think there are any outright bad ships.

Secondly, I'm not a fan of the modular loadouts introduced with the new Armada
fleet. While the concept is cool and allows you to fine tune an individual
pilot, I find that this system takes away most of their individual identities.
With a choice of two unique specials and six shared firing patterns, these
ships feel rather homogenous. I would've rather had the Armada fleet split up
into six individual pilots, so that each ship feels distinct in its playstyle
similar to the classic and treason ships.

So with all of this ship variety, I find the lack of a test drive mode to be a
rather curious ommission. Considering that you'll need to individual unlock
most of your fleet in the in-game store, there's no way to test out a pilot and
see if you like their playstyle before you make the commitment. Such a mode
would also allow you to get a basic grasp of their mechanics in a danger-free
environment and quickly swap between ships for practice. As it is, you'll have
to load into a level and wait for the unskippable text to pass before you can
try them out, which is rather annoying.

Speaking of the in-game shop, there is a staggering amount of unlockable
content. From new ships, challenges, and harder difficulty modes, there's a lot to
keep you coming back.  LIKE:

DISLIKE:

Judgment doesn't explain that vaunt cannot clear out green bullets. Not a fan of that
Game is a bit easy on normal and difficult. Need to bump it up to Legendary to get some challenge. Might just be me.
