Jamestown Plus Review

-- show montage of bullet dodging--

Well here we are. After five years, Jamestown Plus finally makes its way to PC.
Let's see how this version of the game holds up after nearly a decade since the
original Steam release.

For those of you that are unfamiliar with Bullet Hell shooters, here's a small
collection of gameplay to get you brought up to speed.  --Play DoDonpachi,
Deathsmiles, Mushishihimesama, Blue Revolver--

While individual mechanics and aesthetics can greatly differ in these titles,
all good shooters abide by two essential rules.

1). Visual Clarity. 

Can the player track what's happening onscreen at any given moment? 
Can they distinguish what lies in the foreground versus the background? Is it
easy to tell what is and is not an enemy?  Are projectiles distinct
from all other objects, so that they don't blend into their surroundings?

No matter how many bullets are flying across the screen, a well-designed shmup
should always be visually readable by the player. 


2). Precise Player Movement

Given that shooters often require pixel perfect timing to avoid attacks,
accurate player movement is necessary. In general, you should always be able to
predict where your ship will go at any given moment. So systems like
acceleration or ending inertia directly work against this principle, as it
burderns the playerwith needless micromanagement.  



Although I've noticed some issues with visual clarity, Jamestown otherwise
meets these criteria, while adding in some of its own interesting mechanics to
change things up. 


LIKE:

Great aesthetics
Lots of ships to try out to tailor to your playstyle
vaunting is a great mechanic that adds in a lot of depth to the game. 
Lots of unlockable modes, ships, and challenges that add in replayability. 

DISLIKE:

Judgment doesn't explain that vaunt cannot clear out green bullets. Not a fan of that
No way to try out ships ina training mode to get used to their mechanics. Need to figure it out in the level. 
Balance of the ships seems a bit questionable. Like, while bomber can deal a lot of damage manually detonating his shots, gunner has 360 degree bullets, which is a lot more useful. In general, anyone with moveable projectiles seems to be more versatile. 
Game is a bit easy on normal and difficult. Need to bump it up to Legendary to get some challenge. Might just be me. 
Loading times are annoying, with the text being unskippable. Not a problem on its own, but frustrating when restarting a lot to do a no hit run.
