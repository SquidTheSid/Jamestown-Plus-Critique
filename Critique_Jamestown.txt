Jamestown Plus Critique

-- show montage of bullet dodging--

Well here we are. After five long years, Jamestown Plus finally makes its way
to PC.  Featuring four additional pilots, two brand new
levels, and the super gauntlet mode, there's a lot of new content on
display here. Let's see how this version of the game holds up after nearly a
decade since the original Steam release.

For those of you that are unfamiliar with Bullet Hell shooters, here's a small
collection of gameplay to get you brought up to speed.  --Play DoDonpachi,
Deathsmiles, Mushishihimesama, Blue Revolver--

While individual mechanics and aesthetics greatly differ in these titles, all
good shooters abide by two essential rules.

1). Visual Clarity. 

Can the player track what's happening onscreen at any given moment?  Can they
distinguish what lies in the foreground versus what's in the background? Is it
easy to tell what is and is not an enemy?  Are projectiles distinct from all
other objects, so that they don't blend into their surroundings?

No matter how many bullets are flying across the screen, a well-designed shmup
should always be visually readable by the player. 


2). Precise Player Movement

Given that shooters often require pixel perfect timing to avoid attacks,
accurate player movement is necessary. In general, you should always be able to
predict where your ship will go at any given moment. So systems like
acceleration or ending inertia directly work against this principle.

Although I've noticed some issues with visual clarity, Jamestown otherwise
meets these criteria, while adding in some of its own interesting mechanics.

Let me briefly talk about the combat basics. Every ship has access to a primary
attack, a special, and the vaunt ability. With the exception of the Armada
fleet, each pilot has a fixed firing pattern for their primary. Beam will
shotgun out a spread of projectiles, whereas Gunner shoots out a more
concentrated pillar of them. A pilot's special is usually an alternate attack,
but they can also be provide utility. For example, Ghost creates a doppelganger
that fires bullets, while Gunner can reposition his primary fire's angle. No
pilot shares the same special, so each ship feels distinct in their
role.

When the player collects enough gold from enemies, they can trigger a vaunt. On
activation, a temporary shield is created around the player, blocking any
incoming projectiles. Additionally, until Vaunt's duration runs out, you'll
gain a 2x score multiplier and deal 50% additional damage.  On top of that,
when Vaunt expires, you'll receive an additional lump score bonus based on how
long it was active. Finally, the player can prematurely end vaunt to create an
emergency projectile shield, at the expense of putting vaunt accumulation on a
cooldown.  

Mastering this ability is key to success in Jamestown. The utility of clearing
out bullets for a short duration cannot be underestimated, as it can easily
allow you to reposition yourself out of the line of fire and save you from
death. Vaunting grants the player several tactical options available at any
given moment. Do you let it quickly expire to spam the defensive aspect of the
ability, or do you draw out its duration to maximize DPS and score?
Additionally, you'll need to decide if you want to prematurely end a vaunt, as
it can save you from fatal damage, at the expense of killing your score combo.
Overall, Vaunt adds in a nice layer of strategic depth to the already chaotic
bullet dodging, while forcing the player to consider the metagame ramifications
of their moment-to-moment decisions. 

Where Jamestown also sets itself apart from other shooters is with its insane
ship variety. You can choose between 12 unique pilots, 3 of which have
customizable specials and firing patterns.  While I appreciate all of this
choice, I do think there are some oversights with their mechanical designs, as
a result.  First, the benefit of being able to fire from any angle makes makes
certain ships more reliable than others.  Most notably, the Gunner pilot, which
has 360 degree bullet firing, is the most useful on a regular basis. That's not
to say that the other ships are bad, but I find Gunner's improved positioning
to be more useful than the extra DPS potential from ships with static firing
angles like Bomber.

Let's examine each pilot in more depth. 

Beam is the beginner pilot, being well balanced all-around, but not
excelling at anything in particular. He's got a cone shaped shotgun-spread of
bullets, which allows him to slightly juke enemies while still hitting them.
His special is a massive laser beam that deals insane damage to anything it
hits, but slows him to a crawl during the process. I think of the "noob
friendly" pilots in the game (gunpowder, beam, charge, and treason), I find him
to be the most versatile all around, thanks in part to his solid firing
pattern. 

Charge is a boss killer. While her energy ball takes a while to power up, it
deals a ridiculous amount of damage to anything it touches. And unlike Beam, it
travels through obstactles in the environment, allowing you to take some
potshots behind cover.  However, this is offset by the ship pilot zero angled
attacks. And considering that the orb travels rather slowly, you need to plan
ahead with your specials, as the pilot easily gets overwhelmed by mobs.
Personally, I'm not a huge fan of her playstyle, as I don't enjoy having to put
myself in the direct line of enemy fire to deal any damage. 

If you're a masochist and hate your life, then Bomber is the perfect pilot for
you!  He's easily the worst ship in the game. How his gimmick works is that he
shoots out a slow stream of weak bullets. At any point, he can detonate these
projectiles before they collide to create a small but highly damaging
explosion.  In theory, this is a great idea, and in practice if you're
aggressive enough, you can deal some outright obscene damage. However, there
are a lot of problems with his gameplay loop. You need to either be dangerously
close to spam explosions, or split your attention between dodging and exploding
bombs, which leads to death. He requires so much micromanagement to be halfway
decent at dealing damage, a liability that none of the other ships have.
Overall, he just feels punishing to play as. If his explosion and projectile
radii were larger, then that'd give you some more breathing room to spam
explosions or dodge more efficiently. But as it is, I cannot recommend playing
as Bomber when every other pilot is far less suicidal.

On the opposite end of the spectrum we have Gunner, my favorite pilot. 

Treason is unique in that he is the fastest pilot in the game. However, he's
got several downsides to counterbalance this. 1). His primary attack can only
target one direction, so he's weak against enemies that chase him or are out of
his direct line of fire. He does have homing missles to help out, but those
greatly slow him down and can't be used to specifically target an enemy.Given
that his primary fire deals a mediocre amount of damage, you need to use
missles toclear enemies at a reasonable rate. He overall struggles against
large mobs (stage 3 in particular) and bullet frenzies (as his speed makes it
harder to control around bullets), but can do some solid work against larger
foes due to the high burst DPS from his missles.

Gundpower can deal some insane burst damage due to his three orbital TNT
barrels. However, when you fire one off using your special, your primary attack
becomes weaker. Additionally, the barrels have a "sweet" spot where they can do
damage, so you need to keep this in mind or else you'll whiff enemies. The
barrels have fairly good aoe and are strong at clearing mobs so long as you're
in the effective targeting range, but he has no way to protect himself from
being flanked by enemies. I find him to be a more AoE-centric version of
Charge. While he has less sustained damage, he can handle packs enemies with
much more ease. 

Ghost is the most unusual ship in the game. Simply put, you're playing as two
ships simultaneously. His primary fire deals  rather mediocre damage.  However,
this all changes when you use his special. Depending on where you activated it,
Ghost will create a astral projection of himself that constants shoots out a
line of swords above it, and a cone of beams below it. Activating the special
in another location will cause the specter to move to that location. Pressing
it again will recall said spirit. While this phantom is out, Ghost is
restricted to using a short-ranged melee weapon with incredible damage.  I'd
say of all of the pilots in the game, he has the highest skill floor, as
knowing the exact enemy spawn locations in each level is required to maximize
the spirit's effectiveness. Additionally, you need to be far more aggressive
than any other ship in order to deal damage, which increases the risk of
getting hit. Proper usage of vaunt is absolutely essential for survival. The
upside to all of this is that Ghost can clear through crowds and bosses
incredibly quickly once mastered. 


Armada


Secondly, I'm not a fan of the modular loadouts introduced with the new Armada
fleet. While the concept is cool and allows you to fine tune an individual
pilot, I find that this system takes away most of their individual identities.
With a choice of two unique specials and six shared firing patterns, these
ships feel rather homogenous. I would've rather had the Armada fleet split up
into six individual pilots, so that each ship feels distinct in its playstyle
similar to the classic and treason ships.

Curiously, there's no practice mode to test drive new pilots.  Considering that
you'll need to individual unlock most of your fleet in the in-game store,
there's no way to test out a ship and see if you like their playstyle before
you make the commitment. Such a mode would also allow you to get a basic grasp
of their mechanics in a danger-free environment and quickly swap between ships
for practice. As it is, you'll have to load into a level and wait for the
unskippable text to pass before you can try them out, which is rather annoying.

Speaking of the in-game shop, there is a staggering amount of unlockable
content. From new ships, challenges, and harder difficulty modes, there's a lot
to keep you coming back.  

--talk about each level--


CONCLUSION:

Overall, Jamestown Plus is a great improvement over the original due to how
much new and improved content it has. If you're new to bullet hell shooters or
want a local co-op game to play with friends, then you're in for an excellent,
if somewhat brutal, time. 

DISLIKE (NOTES):

Judgment doesn't explain that vaunt cannot clear out green bullets. Not a fan
of that Game is a bit easy on normal and difficult. Need to bump it up to
Legendary to get some challenge. Might just be me.
